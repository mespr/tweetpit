        <p>This is an experiment. Say what you want. A few posts a day are
        randomly selected. The rest are forgotten. From this random set one
        is featured. Help weed out the offensive or profane, and promote what's
        interesting by voting on posts from the random set.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a parody of today's social media, with its firehouse of posts.
        You only see ten, but can scream to the wind. A lottery determines what rants
        get through and participants vote on the ten who passed the lottery to
        see what's featured.</p>
        <p>It is a tiny app with minimal dependencies, no identity or cookies.
        <a href="https://github.com/mespr/tweetpit">View source</a>. The rotation rules are
        currently assuming a tiny audience to mimic a larger participation.
        So currently swapping rapidly.</p>
